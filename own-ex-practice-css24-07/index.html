        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automation are two of the biggest
          technology trends that will continue to transform industries in 2023.
          AI will enable machines to learn and make decisions like humans, while
          automation will streamline processes and reduce human error.

          It's all about the smell, the taste, how it looks, is it crunchy and
          how does it feel in my mouth. Each sense organs have special receptors
          that detect stimuli. When a receptor attuned to taste on your taste
          bud is stimulated, it produces an electrical signal.

          Most definitions of the term specify that automobiles are designed to
          run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to six people,
          typically have four wheels, and be constructed principally for the
          transport of people rather than goods.
